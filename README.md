# Maximizing Gain from Market Predictions

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that forecasts:
1. The numerical change in the market (positive or negative) over a specified time frame.
2. The time required to reach the predicted market change.

The model should optimize the company’s financial gain based on the following profit and loss structure:

1. **Market Increase > 50 points**: Loss of 20% of the predicted value.
2. **0 ≤ Market Increase ≤ 50 points**: Gain equal to the predicted value.
3. **Market Increase < 0 points**: Loss of 50 plus the absolute value of the predicted market increase.

## Approach

### 1. Data Exploration and Pre-processing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured proper data types.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created lag features, technical indicators, and temporal features.
- **Train-Test Split**: Implemented time-series split to preserve temporal order.
- **Scaling**: Standardized features using StandardScaler where necessary.

### 2. Model Choice and Reasoning
- **Numerical Change Prediction**: 
  - Used ARIMA and Gradient Boosting for predicting market changes based on historical data and engineered features.
- **Time to Reach Change Prediction**:
  - Applied regression models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to estimate the time required for the market to reach the predicted change.

### 3. Custom Evaluation Metric
- Developed a custom evaluation function to align model predictions with the company’s profit/loss rules. The metric calculates the overall profit or loss based on predicted market changes and optimizes the model to maximize gain.

### 4. Evaluating Final Model Performance
- **Custom Metric Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using the custom profit/loss metric to ensure alignment with company goals.
- **Traditional Metrics**: Tracked MSE and MAE for comparative analysis.
- **Residual Analysis**: Analyzed residuals to check for patterns and model robustness.

### 5. Suggestions for Further Improvement
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune model parameters to improve performance.
- **Feature Selection**: Use techniques like recursive feature elimination to identify important features.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Explore ensemble learning approaches to combine predictions from multiple models.
- **External Data**: Integrate additional data such as economic indicators and news sentiment to enhance predictions.
- **Adaptive Models**: Implement online learning or retrain models regularly to adapt to market changes.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and ready for model training.
2. **Model Training**: Run the training scripts to build the predictive models.
3. **Evaluation**: Use the provided evaluation functions to assess model performance.
4. **Improvement**: Apply suggestions for further enhancement to optimize the model’s accuracy and financial gain.

## Conclusion

This project aims to build a predictive model that not only forecasts market changes but also aligns with the company’s financial objectives by maximizing overall gain.
